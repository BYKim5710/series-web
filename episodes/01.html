          <h2>Author Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"><strong>Byung Youn Kim</strong></p>

          <p>
            Born in 1957, Byung Youn Kim graduated from the Department of Business Administration at Yonsei
            University and completed the MBA program at Purdue University. He worked for more than 20 years
            in Daewoo Shipbuilding and Samsung Electronics, primarily in marketing. He also served as the Head
            of Internationalization and Foreign Language Education at Samsung Human Resources Development Center.
            Later, he worked as an adjunct professor and lecturer at Gachon University, Shingu University,
            Yonsei University (Wonju Campus), and Howon University. Currently, he is running Dures Management
            Research Institute, a company he founded.
          </p>

          <h3>Published Works</h3>
          <p>
            His published works include <em>The Samsung Myth Has Yet a Long Way to Go</em>, <em>The Gordian Knot</em>,
            <em>Opening Pandora's Box of Korea</em>, <em>Thirty Letters to Jeong-Ah</em>, and <em>Soul and Zero (靈과 零)</em>.
          </p>

          <h3>The Beginning: Fear of Death and a 1977 Experience</h3>
          <p>
            When he was in the 5th grade, the fear of death first struck him deeply as he witnessed the passing of
            his great-grandparents. Since then, the fear of death continued to torment him. In the spring of 1977,
            as he crossed the university gate, he had a life-altering experience akin to being struck by lightning
            on a clear day. He rushed into the office of KUSA (Korean UNESCO Student Association) in a dazed state
            and scribbled down something while in a semi-conscious state.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “All beings consist of body, mind, and spirit. The body and mind, which experience fatigue, will perish.
            But the spirit, which has existed since the beginning and will exist eternally, is the essence of all beings.
            This spirit never dies and continues to exist.”
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Deeper Questions: The Self Without Mind</h3>
          <p>
            This statement pushed him further into introspection. He could accept that the body perishes, as it is visibly evident.
            But he could not accept the idea of the self—who cannot think or be conscious—continuing to exist.
          </p>

          <h3>Expanding the Inquiry: Scriptures and Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            To find answers, he began immersing himself in religious texts and encountered various scriptures.
            He also grew curious about how philosophers approached these issues and delved into their writings.
          </p>

          <h3>Writing and Accumulation</h3>
          <p>
            In 2005, he published his first book, <em>The Samsung Myth Has Yet a Long Way to Go</em>. Since then, he has published six more books.
            Without the earlier spiritual experiences, these books would not have been possible.
          </p>

          <h3><em>Soul and Zero</em> (2010) and the Question of Spirit</h3>
          <p>
            His seventh book, published in 2010, was a comparative religion text titled <em>Soul and Zero (靈과 零)</em>.
            After reading every scripture he could find, he concluded that all existence is one.
            He was able to accept the idea of spirit (靈) as the essence of existence, excluding mind.
            However, even then, he lacked a clear definition of spirit.
          </p>

          <h3><em>The Grand Design</em> and “Zero (零)”</h3>
          <p>
            After publishing <em>Soul and Zero</em>, he read Stephen Hawking’s <em>The Grand Design</em>.
            That book convinced him that answers to religious and social science questions might be found within the laws of nature.
            He was particularly struck by the concept:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “Every substance has a corresponding anti-substance, and when they interact, they return to their original state—zero (零).”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The “zero” in the title <em>Soul and Zero</em> was intended to reflect this very concept. He became fascinated by this principle.
          </p>

          <h3>Consilience and <em>Nosome (無有)</em></h3>
          <p>
            Through further reading in natural sciences, he came to realize that the answers he sought lay embedded in natural laws, waiting to be discovered.
            This led him to conclude that the laws of religion and society are not separate from those of nature—they are closely interconnected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016, he organized his thoughts on the essence of being, the true nature of life, and the definition of God as derived from natural laws,
            and began preparing a manuscript in English titled <em>Nosome (無有)</em>.
          </p>

          <h3>Publishing <em>Conversation with Oneness God</em> (2022)</h3>
          <p>
            In 2018, he resolved to write the book he had long dreamed of, giving it the title <em>Conversation with God</em>.
            However, since he had never written in dialogue form and had no clear structure in mind, he spent some time leaving only fragmentary notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, on January 14, 2021—the first anniversary of his father's passing—he visited his columbarium and decided to begin writing in earnest.
            As a result, he published <em>Conversation with Oneness God</em> in January 2022.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- 2) BOOK -->
        <section id="book" class="card">
          <h2>Book Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"><strong><em>Conversation with Oneness God</em></strong></p>

          <h3>Why This Title</h3>
          <p>
            The reason he chose the title <em>Conversation with Oneness God</em> is that the central teaching of both the Buddha and Jesus
            was that “all beings are one.” A true understanding of this concept naturally leads to a proper understanding of the divine.
          </p>

          <h3>Subtitle: “A Spiritual Solution through Divine Consilience”</h3>
          <p>
            He added the subtitle, “A Spiritual Solution through Divine Consilience,” because he frequently experienced brief words or phrases
            flashing into his mind—either through inspiration from within or through sudden insight from outside. When he captured these fragments,
            they would form coherent sentences. Sometimes ideas about the book’s content and structure were even revealed through dreams.
            Such mystical experiences continued throughout the writing process.
          </p>

          <h3>Why “Divine Consilience”</h3>
          <p>
            He emphasized “Divine Consilience” to reflect his effort to seek answers in the context of 21st-century advanced natural sciences.
            While ancient Greek philosophers attempted to resolve religious issues through the integration of social and natural sciences,
            their answers lacked clarity and precision. He has termed this earlier effort “Old Consilience.”
          </p>

          <h3>What He Hopes Readers Gain</h3>
          <p>
            He hopes readers will come to a clearer understanding of the afterlife and the meaning of God, and use this insight to design and live lives
            that align with those truths. His wish is that the book might help people boldly accept their destinies—not entrusting them to unknown forces—
            and instead lead healthy, positive lives through their own strength.
          </p>

          <h3>Holy Spirit and Divinity in All Beings</h3>
          <p>
            He also emphasizes that the Holy Spirit is not the exclusive property of religious people—it dwells equally in all beings.
            The Buddha and Jesus both recognized this and achieved enlightenment by discovering their own divinity.
          </p>

          <h3>A Call for Religion to Reorient</h3>
          <p>
            He hopes that the true essence of existence as preached by Jesus—the reality of life after death, and the truth that we are all expressions of God—
            will serve as the compass for religion. Religion should cultivate the centrifugal force of love and fulfill its true role of offering genuine faith to all people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Religious institutions that have concealed and distorted the truth must take this opportunity to repent and reorient themselves toward their true function.
            He hopes this book will be the last religious book he writes, and that it will become a small seed and spark of a genuine religious revolution.
          </p>

          <h3>Consilience as a Method</h3>
          <p>
            Just as branches of natural science converge to create new products and services that enrich our lives,
            we must now pursue consilience—the integration of social and natural sciences—to discover answers to the many questions humanity has long sought.
            Based on truths and facts revealed through this process, we should construct sound theories and shared knowledge, refining them collaboratively.
          </p>

          <h3>Book Structure (4 Chapters)</h3>
          <p>
            This book consists of four chapters:
          </p>
          <ol class="muted" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
            <li>
              The first chapter analyzes contradictions in the Old Testament to help readers understand that much of it is mythology based on partial historical fact,
              and why Jesus proclaimed a new covenant that departed from the Old Testament.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second chapter explains how Jesus’s revolutionary intentions for social reform were thwarted,
              and how Paul’s ideas became the foundation of modern Christian doctrine.
            </li>
            <li>
              The third chapter exposes the fallacy of the afterlife and reexamines the meaning of “heaven on earth” as preached by Jesus.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fourth and final chapter connects the truths declared by enlightened figures such as Jesus and the Buddha regarding God and the essence of existence
              with the principles of natural law.
            </li>
          </ol>
