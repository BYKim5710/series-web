          <p>
            Born in 1957, Byung Youn Kim graduated from Yonsei University (Business Administration) and completed the MBA program at Purdue University.
            He worked for over 20 years at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Samsung Electronics, mainly in marketing, and later served as Head of Internationalization
            and Foreign Language Education at Samsung Human Resources Development Center.
          </p>
          <p>
            He later taught as an adjunct professor/lecturer at multiple universities, and currently runs Dures Management Research Institute, a company he founded.
            His published works include <i>The Samsung Myth Has Yet a Long Way to Go</i>, <i>The Gordian Knot</i>, <i>Opening Pandora’s Box of Korea</i>,
            <i>Thirty Letters to Jeong-Ah</i>, and <i>Soul and Zero (靈과 零)</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A childhood encounter with death led him to lifelong inquiry. In 1977, he experienced a life-altering insight and wrote down a statement he still remembers:
          </p>

          <div class="quote">
            “All beings consist of body, mind, and spirit. The body and mind, which experience fatigue, will perish.
            But the spirit, which has existed since the beginning and will exist eternally, is the essence of all beings.
            This spirit never dies and continues to exist.”

      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The title <b>Conversation with Oneness God</b> reflects the author’s view that the central teaching of both the Buddha and Jesus is that
          “all beings are one,” and that understanding this leads to a clearer understanding of the divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subtitle, <b>A Spiritual Solution through New Consilience</b>, emphasizes a method:
          seeking answers in the context of 21st-century natural sciences and integrating social and natural sciences beyond earlier “old consilience.”
        </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p><b>Author’s intent</b></p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>To help readers gain a clearer understanding of the afterlife and the meaning of God, and live accordingly.</li>
          <li>To emphasize that the Holy Spirit is not exclusive to religious people; it dwells equally in all beings.</li>
          <li>To call religious institutions that concealed or distorted truth to repentance and reorientation toward their true function.</li>
          <li>To plant a “seed and spark” for a genuine Religious Revolution.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p><b>Structure of the Book (4 Chapters)</b></p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li><b>Chapter 1</b> — Analyzes contradictions in the Old Testament; argues much of it is mythology based on partial historical fact, and explains why Jesus proclaimed a new covenant distinct from the Old Testament.</li>
          <li><b>Chapter 2</b> — Explains how Jesus’s revolutionary intentions for social reform were thwarted, and how Paul’s ideas became a foundation of modern Christian doctrine.</li>
          <li><b>Chapter 3</b> — Reexamines the afterlife and “heaven on earth,” challenging conventional religious depictions.</li>
          <li><b>Chapter 4</b> — Connects truths declared by enlightened figures such as Jesus and the Buddha regarding God and the essence of existence with principles of natural law.</li>

        <p>
          “New Consilience” here means a modern integration of knowledge—especially linking insights from natural sciences
          with social sciences—so that questions about life, death, spirit, and society are examined with clearer methods and evidence.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li><b>Modern scientific context:</b> the author insists religious questions must be revisited in the era of advanced natural sciences.</li>
          <li><b>Integration, not separation:</b> laws of religion and society are not isolated from nature; they are interconnected.</li>
          <li><b>Practical orientation:</b> the goal is not abstract theory, but a worldview that changes how we live and organize community.</li>

        <h2>Recommendation</h2>
        <small>Jongrok Lee (PhD, Old Testament Studies)</small>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          An Old Testament scholar and longtime seminary professor frames his recommendation around a serious problem:
          many Christians—including pastors—do not read, study, or properly understand the Bible, relying instead on stereotypes.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          “The people who are supposed to be Bible experts don’t know the Bible… the majority of Christians who hold it up as the absolute truth
          don’t bother to read it, don’t study it, don’t understand it properly… and reject what biblical scholars teach.”
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;">
          He describes the author as a lifelong truth-seeker who read the Bible more often and more thoroughly than many believers,
          sought advice from experts, revised repeatedly, and produced a large manuscript through persistent work.
        </p>

        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>The book is recommended as a <b>warning</b> against complacency and “Bible-ignorance.”</li>
          <li>It challenges inherited belief and urges readers to confront the text and reality directly.</li>
          <li>It calls Christians to stop rejecting scholarship and start reading what they claim to honor.</li>
        </ul>
