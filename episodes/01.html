            <h3>Education & Career</h3>
            <p>
              Born in 1957, Byung Youn Kim graduated from the Department of Business Administration at Yonsei University
              and completed the MBA program at Purdue University. He worked for more than 20 years in Daewoo Shipbuilding
              and Samsung Electronics, primarily in marketing. He also served as the Head of Internationalization and
              Foreign Language Education at Samsung Human Resources Development Center.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, he worked as an adjunct professor and lecturer at Gachon University, Shingu College, Yonsei University
              (Wonju Campus), and Howon University. He currently runs Dures Management Research Institute.
            </p>

            <h3>Books</h3>
            <p>
              His publications include <em>Samsung Myth: Still a Long Way to Go</em>, <em>The Gordian Knot</em>,
              <em>Opening Korea’s Pandora’s Box</em>, <em>Thirty Letters to Jeong-a</em>, and <em>Spirit & Zero</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>The Beginning: Fear of Death & the 1977 Experience</h3>
            <p>
              He first encountered the fear of death in elementary school when his great-grandparents passed away.
              In the spring of 1977, he experienced a sudden flash of insight that became the starting point of a long pursuit
              to understand existence, life and death, and what remains beyond the disappearance of body and mind.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              “All beings are composed of body, mind, and spirit. The body and mind can vanish, but the spirit—the essence—
              has existed since the beginning and continues eternally.”
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Consilience</h3>
            <p>
              Through comparative study of scriptures, philosophy, and modern science, he became convinced that answers to
              long-standing religious questions can be clarified by natural laws—and that social sciences and natural sciences
              are deeply connected.

            <p class="lead"><strong>Conversation with Oneness God</strong></p>

            <h3>Why this title?</h3>
            <p>
              The core message taught by the great sages—such as the Buddha and Jesus—is the truth of oneness:
              all beings are fundamentally connected. Understanding this is essential to understanding the meaning of God.
            </p>

            <h3>What the book aims to do</h3>
            <p>
              This book invites readers to examine the afterlife and the meaning of God with clarity, to design life
              accordingly, and to live with courage—without outsourcing one’s destiny to unknown forces.
            </p>

            <h3>Structure (4 chapters)</h3>
            <p>
              The book is organized into four chapters: (1) a critical analysis of contradictions in the Old Testament,
              (2) how Jesus’s reformative intent was derailed and how Pauline doctrine became dominant, (3) a critique of
              fictionalized afterlife concepts and the meaning of “Heaven on Earth,” and (4) a synthesis of the sages’ insights
              with natural laws.
